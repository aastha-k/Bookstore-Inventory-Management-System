# Bookstore-Inventory-Management-System

Designed and implemented a bookstoreâ€™s inventory management system.
A typical bookstore ecosystem has the following items:
- Books
- Magazines
- Store manager
- Cashier
- Customer
Apart from this, the bookstore needs to keep an inventory of the books it has, how many copies it has, the price of each book, cost of each book to the store, etc. Whenever books are sold by the store, or new stock is added to the store, the inventory needs to be updated. I have implemented a bookstore with the above entities in C++. I defined the attributes and behaviours of these entities and develop the bookstore using an OOP model.
